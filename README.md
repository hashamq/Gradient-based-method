# Gradient-based-method

This method is developed to create adversarial images in Support Vector Machines.

- GradientBaseMethodSVM module will generate the adversarial inputs in SVM. Initially, the handwritten digits dataset is more suitable to validate this method.

- TestAdversarialInputs module can be used to predict and verify the adversarial inputs by using the trained SVM Model.
